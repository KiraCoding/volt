### Linux
#### Arch Linux / Manjaro:
```sh
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1
```

####  Debian / Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev
```

#### Fedora
```sh
sudo dnf install gtk3-devel webkit2gtk4.1-devel
```

### macOS
WebKit is native on macOS so everything should be fine.

### Windows
WebView2 provided by Microsoft Edge Chromium is used. Volt supports Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11.
